Getting started

Weekend Server Reset

p
The server reset on 2023-05-13 at 11:00AM PST to accomodate new players and push important fixes to the game.

p
We are also working on a detailed plan for how we manage resets in the future and will communicate that plan in the docs and on Discord when it is ready.

p
SpaceTraders is an API-based game where you acquire and manage a fleet of ships to explore, trade, and fight your way across the galaxy.

Overview

p
SpaceTraders is an open-universe game and learning platform that offers a set of HTTP endpoints to control a fleet of ships and explore a multiplayer universe.

p
The API is documented using OpenAPI and Stoplight Studio. You can send your first request right here in your browser to check the status of the game server.

Send Request

code
curl 'https://api.spacetraders.io/v2/'

p
Unlike a traditional game, SpaceTraders does not have a first-party client or app to play the game. Instead, you can use the API to build your own client, write a script to automate your ships, or try an app built by the community.

p
We have a Discord channel where you can share your projects, ask questions, and get help from other players.

Gameplay

p
The goal of the game is to manage a fleet of ships as you explore the universe and try to turn a profit. You can trade goods across systems, mine asteroids for valuable ores, or take on faction contracts to earn credits and reputation.

p
All players operate in the same universe, so you can compete with others to earn the most credits or chart the most systems. The game is currently in alpha, and we plan to add player-vs-player combat, bounty hunting, and more.

Roadmap

p
We plan to work toward the following features and capabilities. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please share them in our Discord channel.

li
scavenge derelict ships for valuable cargo and spare parts

li
create webhooks to receive notifications when events occur in the game

li
search for ancient artifacts on distant planets to sell for profit

li
send envoys to meet new factions and generate contracts or unique trade deals

li
private game worlds deployed on a separate server for testing or playing with friends

li
take on bounties to earn credits or pirate other players trade routes

li
a GraphQL API for querying systems and waypoints

li
deploy envoys to track rumors and generate contracts

Funding

p
We are a small self-funded team dedicated to keeping the SpaceTraders platform alive and accessible for everyone, and free for as long as we can support it.

p
You can donate to the project using the link below. Contributions will go directly towards maintaining server costs for the community. As we fund everything out of pocket, every donation, no matter the size, makes a big difference.

p
Weâ€™re grateful for your support and excited to see what you build with the SpaceTraders API!

Next steps

p
The SpaceTraders API is an excellent platform to learn a new programming language, test a new framework, or stretch your skills in a fun and meaningful way.

p
If you are new to SpaceTraders, you should try our interactive quickstart guide which will walk you through basic API requests in just a few minutes.

p
If you're looking for some project inspiration, here are some ideas to get you started:

li
create a script to mine asteroids and automate trade routes
