Work in Progress

This feature is in active development and may not be fully implemented.

p
Ships require maintenance to keep them in good working order and you can repair your ship at a shipyard.

p
Ships will take damage from combat and other hazards, including actions such as mining, scavenging, and docking into heavy atmospheres.

p
As the condition of your ship decreases, actions will take longer to complete, and you will be more likely to take more damage.

p
You can conduct spot-repairs while in orbit, but you will need to return to a shipyard to perform a full repair.
