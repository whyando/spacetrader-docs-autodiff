Agents and Factions

Overview

p
Agents are the primary entity in SpaceTraders. Every player controls a single agent which can be used to manage a fleet of ships and conduct trade with factions.

p
The API token generated when you register is scoped to your agent. You can use this token to control your agent and view the status of your fleet.

p
Every endpoint under the /my namespace requires an API token and returns data specific to your agent. For example, you can use the following API request to view your current reputation with each faction.

code
curl 'https://api.spacetraders.io/v2/my/factions' \ --header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'

p
Agent vs Account

p
An agent is not the same as your SpaceTraders account. Accounts are tied to an email address and allow you to login to the dashboard to manage API tokens and webhooks.

p
To register as a new agent, you must choose a unique call sign and a starting faction. This call sign is used to identify yourself to other players in the universe.

p
This will grant you a command ship, 100,000 credits, and a starting faction contract. Your command ship will be docked at the faction's home system.

code
curl --request POST \ --url 'https://api.spacetraders.io/v2/register' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --data '{    "symbol": "YOUR_CALL_SIGN",    "faction": "COSMIC"   }'

p
Once you have registered, you can use the following API request to view your agent's current status. An agent will have a unique call sign, credits, and a headquarters location.

code
curl 'https://api.spacetraders.io/v2/my/agent' \ --header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'

Factions

p
Factions are the primary NPC organizations in SpaceTraders. Each faction will have a unique set of ships, contracts, and trade routes for you to explore.

p
Factions are spread across the universe and can be found by exploring new systems.

p
During the alpha there are only a few factions, but we plan to add more in the future. You can view the current list of factions using the following API request.

code
curl 'https://api.spacetraders.io/v2/factions' \ --header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'

p
Factions will offer contracts to agents in exchange for credits and reputation. Every agent starts with a basic contract to deliver a mined ore to the faction's home world.

p
On accepting a contract, the agent will be given a deadline to complete the terms. If the contract is not completed by the deadline, the agent will lose reputation with the faction.

p
To view your current contracts, you can use the following API request.

code
curl 'https://api.spacetraders.io/v2/my/contracts' \ --header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'

p
As agents complete contracts and conduct trade with factions, they earn reputation, which can be used to unlock new types of ships, upgrades, gate access, and high margin trade goods.

p
Coming Soon

p
This feature is not yet available in the alpha. Agents start with a single contract to deliver mined ores to the faction's home world.

p
Faction contracts can be generated by sending an envoy ship to a faction's home world. Envoys will negotiate with the faction to generate a new contract of the desired type.

p
If the agent doesn't accept the contract, there will be a slight loss in reputation with the faction.

p
As the agent earns more reputation with a faction, they will be able to generate more lucrative contracts. However, contracts will also become more challenging to complete.
