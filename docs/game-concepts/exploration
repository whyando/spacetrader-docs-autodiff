Exploration

Work in Progress

This feature is in active development and may not be fully implemented.

p
Ships can explore the SpaceTraders universe by navigating between waypoints and jumping between systems.

p
Some waypoints contain ancient ruins that can be surveyed for valuable resources and technology.

p
Factions at the edge of the universe are more likely to trade in rare technology and trade goods.

p
Some systems contain hidden hazards that can damage your ship and crew. Exploration is risky but can be very profitable.

h2
Charting

p
Ships can chart a system to make the waypoint information available to other players. Without a chart, ships will need to use their scanners to detect waypoint information or travel to the waypoint to learn about it.

h2
Asteroid Mining

p
Some asteroid waypoints contain an abundance of valuable ores and minerals that can only be uncovered by sending ships to the location to survey and extract the resources.

p
Plotting yields over time can reveal the best locations to mine. However, these sources are not inifinite, and over-mining can cause the asteroids to collapse.
