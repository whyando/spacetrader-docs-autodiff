p
This week is just a light release of bug fixes and minor updates. We will have to skip a reset next weekend due to our schedules, but we'll be back the following week with a new release.

p
The only major change this week is downgrading diamond profitability to be closer to gold and platinum (sorry diamond miners!). There will be two weeks between resets, so maybe the downgrade in diamond prices will stretch things out a bit.

p
We've downgraded some of the extra server resources to optimize costs. There is a small chance we are too close to the limit, which might require some downtime mid-week to add resources back in.

p

An agent symbol that's already taken now throws a 409 error instead of 422 (013037d4)

p
This week we mostly focused on some bug fixes and server maintanence tasks that we've been putting off for a while.

p
Going into our summer schedule, updates might be a bit slower than usual depending on vacation schedules, but we'll still be around to fix bugs and answer questions. We might take the time to work on some larger features that require more time to implement. However we'll continue to maintain regular weekly resets while the economy is hot.

p
Next week we may experiment with extending some of the travel times to make the economy remain balanced longer into the week. As always, if you find any bugs or discover any exploits, please let us know!

p
This week was busier for the team so we didn't have a chance to add any new game mechanics, but we did fix a few bugs and tweak some of the game mechanics from last week's release.

p
In this release, we've implemented several game mechanics updates to improve gameplay experience and balance the universe economy. Notably, warping is now slower than inner-system travel, and exchange purchase/sell prices are more aligned with lower margins across the universe. In addition, new requirements for navigation and adjustments to mining and trade have been introduced to enrich the universe's economy. In response to player feedback and our ongoing testing, we've also resolved several bugs and improved system performance.

p
Breaking

li
Navigation and warp now require the ship to be in orbit (70f88b05)

p
Updates

li
Changed travel mechanics: warping is now slower than inner-system travel (8a258ac0)

li
Rebalanced economy: exchange purchase/sell prices are more aligned, margins are a bit lower across the universe, starter system exchanges now support higher volumes in common ores and minerals, and - have lower trade volume for diamonds (729b29f5, def78e67)

li
Mining lasers now only extract ores and metals; mineral deposits now contain precious stones (def78e67)

li
Preparing to add gas extraction and fuel refinement (bb274b58)

p
Fixes

li
Corrected negotiate contract status from 200 to 201 (fba6e0bd)

li
Fixed bug allowing installation of one more mount than specs allow (2b7ead08)

li
Fixed game description of mineral deposits (bd9f318c)

li
Validated mount symbol on install (7afd2537)

p
Enjoy your updated journey across the universe!

June 03, 2023

p
This week’s reset focused on tweaking the starter system economics and removing some exploits from last week’s release. We also added the ability to install and remove mounts from your ships using the new /my/ships/{shipSymbol}/mounts endpoints.

p
There is only one breaking change this week that will likely affect your scripts. Purchasing a ship will now require a ship to be present at the location of the shipyard. This is to prevent agents from too easily spreading across the galaxy.

p
To continue to make the quickstart as easy as possible, a probe ship is seeded at your starting shipyard to enable ship purchasing right away.

p
We also applied various tweaks to starter systems markets and asteroids:

li
the starting system asteroid now only contains common metal deposits, meaning agents will need to venture outside of the starting system to maximize profits from mining.

li
exchange prices should now better incentivize agents to sell when supplies are low, and purchase when supplies are high

li
trade volume has been lowered across the starting system meaning agents are likely to see more volatile prices early on in the reset

li
market growth / decay is being tested this reset, so players should see trade volume increase with consistent trade and when imports are met (and thus more stable prices)

li
exchanges have been seeded at asteroids in populated systems across the galaxy

li
starting contracts are now much easier to complete due to the smaller trade volumes and various bugs have been fixed

li
contract deliveries should now come from the least supplied markets and the new agent contract should provide better “on-fulfilled” payment terms

li
to compensate for lower contract payments, starting agents will begin with 150,000 credits

li
contracts should start expiring this week and will be removed if you don’t accept the terms; generating new contracts are still a WIP so if you find bugs please let us know

p
Later during this reset we might be adding the ability to install / remove modules as well, but it might wait until the following week. We had a busy weekend with the holiday so there is still a lot of work to do that didn’t make it into this reset.

p
Enjoy and please file bugs and exploits as you explore!

May 20, 2023

p
In this release, we continued to apply fixes and tweak gameplay mechanics. The universe seeder parameters have been updated to offer more factions, more shipyards and more markets. We've also added the ability to generate contracts, which we will further enhance in the next release. Contracts can now expire and the faction will take back any credits advanced to the agent. Agents can only have one contract at a time until we have a chance to add more features around negotiation.

p
Next week we will either need to reset on Friday or the following Monday, or skip a week due to scheduling conflicts with the holiday weekend. We will announce the decision in the #announcements channel on Discord.

p

May 14, 2023

p
This week we focused primarily on bug fixes and internal improvements. We also added the ability to reserve call signs with Stripe donations.

p
The server was reset on May 13, 2023 at 10:00AM PST. All tokens prior to the reset are now invalid. You will need to register a new agent and generate a new access token to play the game.

p
We will be resetting the server on a regular cadence until we are confident that the game is stable enough to run for longer periods of time.

p
This will be announced in the #announcements channel on Discord. We will also add data to the status endpoint to indicate when the next reset will occur, and better handle error messages when users attempt to use an invalid token.

p
Next week we will continue to focus on patching core issues, improving documentation, and solidfying the process around server resets and how we communicate them.
