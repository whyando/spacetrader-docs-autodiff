Purchase Ship

p
Shipyards allow you to purchase ships, and will eventually allow you to repair, as well as swap out different modules and mounts. To purchase a ship, you will need to find a waypoint with a shipyard.

h2
Find a shipyard

p
Look for a waypoint with the SHIPYARD trait. You can use the following endpoint to find all waypoints in your current system. Take note of the symbol for the orbital station waypoint that has a shipyard, which you can use to purchase a mining drone.

Ship Price Visibility

p
Several parts of the API have some fields that are hidden unless you have a ship present at the location.

p
When starting as a new agent, a probe ship was provided for you at this orbital station, which allows you to see the details of the ships available for purchase.

h2
Purchase a ship

p
You can purchase a ship at a shipyard by sending a POST request to the my/ships endpoint. Sending this request will deduct the cost of the ship from your credits and add the ship to your fleet.

p
You will need to specify the type of ship you want to purchase, along with the waypoint you are purchasing from.
