Rate Limits

p
The SpaceTraders API is subject to rate limits. The following is a list that outlines the rate limits that are currently in place:

h2
Response Headers

p
The SpaceTraders API will return the following headers in a 429 response to indicate the current rate limit status:

code
x-ratelimit-type

code
x-ratelimit-limit

code
x-ratelimit-remaining

code
x-ratelimit-reset

code
x-ratelimit-limit-burst

code
x-ratelimit-limit-per-second

p
The only time these response headers are not returned is when the DDoS protection kicks in. In that case, the response will be a 502 Bad Gateway and the response body will be empty.

p
The DDoS protection is in place to protect the SpaceTraders API from being overwhelmed by a large number of requests. If you are receiving a 502 Bad Gateway response, you should wait a few minutes before trying again.

p
We don't publish the exact details of our DDoS protection layer, but it is designed to allow a reasonable number of requests to be made in a short period of time.
